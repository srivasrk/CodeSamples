//C# Happy Number

/*
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

        int SquareSum = 0;
        int Quotient = 0;
        
        while (myset.Add(n)){
            SquareSum = 0;
            while (n > 0){
                Quotient = n % 10;
                SquareSum = SquareSum + (Quotient * Quotient);
                n = n/10;
            }
            if (SquareSum == 1){
                return true;
            } else {
                n = SquareSum;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
        
    }
